General:
 - Replace favicon.ico with a proper favicon
 - Update manifest.json: "manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the homescreen on Android. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/". Also the theme-color <meta> tag.
 - What's the equivalent of manifest.json for Apple stuff?

Scene:
 - follow (or react to) the cursor:
    on click, spawn orbs
    on right click, pull orbs
 - different initial states, e.g. all of them start in the center shot out in a circular pattern, or all of them start on the single side
 - better direction-switching algorithm?
 - add option to change speed
 - add option to make all orbs the same size and color

Use new technologies:
 - Use Flow. create-react-app has built-in support for it, see section "Adding Flow" in its README
 - Use ESLint, for code checking (compatible with Flow?). It's possible to integrate this with Sublime Text - see "Displaying Lint Output in the Editor" in create-react-app-README.md
 - Use Prettier for automatically formatting the code (Sublime Text support?). create-react-app-README.md mentions this.
